 Monitor the statistics data from ISC Bind daemon (named).
 You need to enable BIND 9 HTTP statistics channel
 (see {https://kb.isc.org/docs/monitoring-recommendations-for-bind-9} for more information)
 
 { statistics-channels { inet 127.0.0.1 port 8080 ; }; }

 Install CheckMK agent plugin /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/plugins/isc_bind_stats.py.
 You can define regex patterns for statistics variable names you want to inventorize.
 Everything is inventorized simply as a request counter. Levels for a request rate can
 be defined. The default level is 1000 r/s for {WARN} and 2000 r/s for {CRIT}.
 This can inform you about DDoS on DNS.

item:
 The statistic variable.

inventory:
 One service is created for every statistic variable whose name matches
 according to discovery rule (list of names or regexes starting with ~).
 By default only the variable "nsstats.Requestv4" is inventorized.
